  Description:
    Create a program that uses a dictionary to associate names with dates of birth

    The program must start by asking for the name. If the name is already in the dictionary, the program returns the name and date of birth

    If the name is not already in the dictionary, the program asks for the day of birth

    When the user types "exit", the program should end showing the complete dictionary
